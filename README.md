# FloodPredictionML
This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict floods. It aims to utilize various data inputs to accurately forecast flood occurrences, providing critical information for disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts.
Contents
The project includes the following:

Data Collection: Gathering relevant data from various sources.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features that improve the model's performance.
Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms to train the model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Prediction: Deploying the model to make real-time predictions.
